# [Project 1: Humanoid Robot](https://youtube.com/shorts/sz7JJU25oyM)
* Created a Humanoid robot as final year venture.
* This is an Arduino/ESP32 based robot used to host international humanoid football matches.
* Heavy duty servos are used by the 16 DOF to perform all specific tasks.
* The MPU-6050 gyro sensor is also used to cope with falls and return to the original state.
* The ESP32 cam module is used for object tracking and face recognition.

# [Project 2: Brain Tumor Detection](https://github.com/layeqaliali/Brain_tumor_detection/blob/main/brain_tumor.ipynb)
* Brain Tumor Detection program is designed to help doctors to find whether patient have this disease with CT scans dataset.
* Scraped over 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium
* Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark. 
* Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model. 
* Built a client facing API using flask

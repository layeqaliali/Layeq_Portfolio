* Created a Humanoid robot as final year venture.
* This is an Arduino/ESP32 based robot used to host international humanoid football matches.
* Heavy duty servos are used by the 16 DOF to perform all specific tasks.
* The MPU-6050 gyro sensor is also used to cope with falls and return to the original state.
* The ESP32 cam module is used for object tracking and face recognition.

# [Project 2: Brain Tumor Detection](https://github.com/layeqaliali/Brain_tumor_detection/blob/main/brain_tumor.ipynb)
* Brain Tumor Detection program is designed to help doctors to find whether patient have this disease with CT scans dataset.
* It uses the sequential model in deep learning.



# [Project 3: German Traffic Sign](https://github.com/layeqaliali/German_traffic_sign_detection)
* This project is designed to identify the road traffic signs.
* A model is trained with 43 traffic signs.
* Sign names are available in signnames.csv file.
